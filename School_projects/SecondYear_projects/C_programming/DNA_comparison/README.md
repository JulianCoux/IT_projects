## DNA brain comparison algorithm

Programming of a DNA brain comparison algorithm to calculate the minimum distance between the two brains.
Programming of 3 different algorithms: 
-a naive iterative algorithm
-a cache-aware optimised algorithm. Cache size taken into account to optimise data storage. The problem is factored into sub-problems of size K (depending on the size of the cache) so that all the data is cached.
-A cache-oblivious optimised algorithm. The programme is recursive and factors out the problem as long as the size of the parameters to be stored does not fall within the set threshold.
Numerous tests were carried out to compare the different algorithms as a function of the size of the DNA brains.
