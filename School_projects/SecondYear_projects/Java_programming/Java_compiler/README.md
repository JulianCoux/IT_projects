# Software Engineering Project - Deca Compiler
ENSIMAG - 2023/2024

Welcome to this repository that contains the software engineering project I completed in my second year at ENSIMAG. This project, undertaken in collaboration with a group of 5 people, spanned over a month. The main objective was to design a compiler for the Deca language, a subset of Java created specifically for this project. The majority of the compiler code is written in Java.

## Project Contents

At the root of this project, you will find the following items:

- **poly-projet-GL.pdf**: This file contains the documentation for the Deca language, providing essential information for understanding and compiling the language.

- **Documents**:
  - **Conception**: A document detailing the content of the project and explaining how it was carried out.
  - **Manuel-Utilisateur**: A user guide explaining how to use my compiler.
  - **Validation**: A document describing the tests conducted to validate the functionality of the compiler, along with the scripts used to facilitate validation.
  - **Documentation Extension**: A report summarizing team management, with a particular focus on the use of the Agile methodology.
  - **Extension Documentation**: A document detailing the implementation of the extension that allows Deca users to use the Math.decah library created by me.
  - **Impact_energetique**: A document analyzing the energy impact generated by the project and the measures taken by my software to limit this impact.

## Important Note

This project was carried out as part of my academic coursework and is not currently open to external contributions. It primarily serves educational and archival purposes.

I wish you an excellent exploration of my software engineering project!

Thank you for your interest!
