## Approximation of the number Pi using the Monte Carlo method

This project involves writing a program comprising two Python files. 
Its primary objectives are twofold: 
  -firstly, to compute an approximate value for Ï€ utilizing a Monte Carlo simulation; 
  -secondly, to generate an animated image illustrating the simulation process as described below.
