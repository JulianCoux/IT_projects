# JPEG Decoder

The aim of this project was to develop a JPEG image decoder in C. The project was carried out in groups of 3 and lasted 1 month.
Understanding and using memory space was essential for producing an efficient algorithm. 
This project enabled me to strengthen my C and project management skills.
