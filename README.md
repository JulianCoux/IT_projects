# Repository of Computer Projects

This GitHub repository serves as a catalog for all my computer projects, encompassing both academic and personal endeavors. It follows this structure:

## Repository Structure

The main directory contains:

- `School_projects/`: Directory housing all projects undertaken during my time at ENSIMAG engineering school.

Within the `School_projects/` directory, you'll find subdirectories corresponding to each academic year at ENSIMAG. Each subdirectory represents a specific academic year and contains projects associated with that period.

## Project Information

For specific details about each project, please navigate to the subdirectories corresponding to the academic years. Each project is accompanied by a detailed README providing information on its objectives, functionality, and specific details.
